# The Phoenix Framework

Have you ever wanted to build applications that are fast, can handle millions \(yes, millions!\) of connections at the same time? Have you ever wanted to just build you web application instead of spending countless hours just configuring your environment? Have you ever wanted fault tolerant, self healing applications that keep working even though the application process may have crashed?

Congratulations! You've come to the right place.

Phoenix is a full stack framework that lets you easily build fast, concurent and fault tolerant applications.
